# Convex_Polygon
Creates a convex polygon from a given set of points if possible, else shows that the set of points only creates a concave one..
This includes an iterative GUI which allows the user to go step-by-step to see how the algorithm manages to give an answer.

*This was originally asked as an interview question at Intel - 'What would be the basic concepts of designing an algorithm which detecs a convex polygon?', I have been by this question ever since and studied concepts of computational geometry to create this piece.

Other features:

[X] Database which allows user to load a previous sets of points

[X] Interaction - 

    [X] Scalling & moving the canvas using mouse to see close points ('+'/'-'/Mouse drag)
    
    [X] Random point generator ('R' to reset points)
    
    [X] Step-by-Step iteration ('N' to jump to next step)
    
    [X] Save points to database ('S' to save)
    
[X] Implementation of dynamic polygons using a connected list of pointers to points.
